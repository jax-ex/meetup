# ElixirConf 2021 in Review

ElixirConf just happened and it was a hybrid in person event. In celebration of
the the first meeting of the greater Elixir community, let's have our first
hybrid meeting. Thanks to Hashrocket we have a place to meet and greet again.
Join us virtually or in person to discuss the highlights of ElixirConf and
celebrate this opportunity to be together.
