# What can Elixir do that Go can't?

Febuary (11th) 2021 presentation presented to Jax.Ex meetup.

Join us for a workshop where we will learn to be a Rustler. No, we aren't stealing cattle. Instead we will be calling out to Rust code from Elixir. At scale the performance of Elixir is very good but there are times when you need mutable data structures. Here is a great article by the team at Discord about how they used a mutable data structure to solve some scale problems:

In this workshop we will use the Rustler library to call out to some Rust code. So try to have Rust and Elixir installed before you show up.

Install Elixir: https://elixir-lang.org/install.html

Install Rust: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

[SKILL LEVEL] Beginner to Intermediate

In traditional Jax.Ex fashion we plan to have a few minutes of social time after the workshop, so bring your favorite drink.
