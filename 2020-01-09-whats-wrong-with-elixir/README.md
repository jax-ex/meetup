# What's Wrong With Elixir?

January (9th) 2020 presentation presented to Jax.Ex meetup.

The pupose of this talk is not to bash Elixir, which is still my prefered
language, but to look at pure funtional design. This talk should generate a
discussion around functional concepts and help us to deepen our knowledge.


## Installation

This project uses reveal-ck which is a ruby gem (library) used to create slides
from markdown. Installation instructions can be found on the website.

Because I preference `bundler` I have included a `Gemfile` you can use it for
an alternative install.

`$ bundle install`
