# Build a Broadway Producer

December (9th) 2021 presentation presented to Jax.Ex meetup.

Broadway supports many producers like Amazon SQS, Apache Kafka, Google Cloud
PubSub, RabbitMQ, and others. But what happens when you want the simple
declarative style of Broadway but don't have an off the shelf producer? You
build it! In this workshop we will build a simple producer that we can use to
build any data ingestion pipeline.
