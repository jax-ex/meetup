# What can Elixir do that Go can't?

January (14th) 2021 presentation presented to Jax.Ex meetup.

NOTE: Someone brought to my attention that this title sounds like a language flame war. The intentions of this talk are to only talk about Elixir, the problems it solves and the abstractions it gives.

You can exchange Go in the title for any language, i.e. "What can Elixir do that Assembly can't?". Any Turing Complete language has been proven to solve any computational (logic) problem. Languages simply give us abstractions.

-- Original --

The title of this talk was a question asked by a co-worker. This talk will not focus on the differences between Go and Elixir or language X and Elixir but on what Elixir does that is different. We will focus on rediscovering what makes Elixir great and how it is different than anything else that exists. We will look at the inspirations for Elixir (Erlang, Clojure and Ruby) and see how Elixir tries to take the best parts of any ecosystem and apply them.

Since this will be the first meetup of the new year we will also spend some time talking about the direction of Jax.Ex for this year. Time to reflect and refocus.
